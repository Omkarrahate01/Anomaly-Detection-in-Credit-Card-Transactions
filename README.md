# Anomaly-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in credit card transactions using Power BI. By visualizing transaction data and identifying patterns, it helps uncover suspicious or fraudulent activities. The project provides interactive dashboards for monitoring and analyzing transaction anomalies.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning and Power BI techniques . The primary goal is to identify anomalies or outliers that signify potential fraudulent activity. Accurate detection of anomalies can help minimize fraud losses and improve the security of financial transactions.

# Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard for anomaly detection in credit card transactions. Anomaly detection is crucial for detecting fraudulent activities and ensuring the security of credit card transactions. By leveraging Power BI's data visualisation and analyzing transaction patterns to differentiate between normal and fraudulent activities. It provide clear visualizations of transaction behaviors and fraud detection results. 

# Datasets
The dataset used for this project contains the following key features:
type - CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.
amount - amount of the transaction in local currency.
oldbalanceOrg - initial balance before the transaction
newbalanceOrig - new balance after the transaction
isFraud - This is the transactions made by the fraudulent agents inside the simulation. In this specific dataset the fraudulent behaviour of the agents aims to profit by taking control of customersâ€™ accounts and try to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system. (Binary label where 0 represents a normal transaction and 1 represents a fraudulent transaction)

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized the data for effective analysis.
Visualization: Created visualizations to show normal vs. fraudulent transactions.

# Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates how Power BI can be used to detect anomalies in credit card transactions. By identifying patterns in transactional data, these models can flag potential fraud, helping financial institutions improve security.
